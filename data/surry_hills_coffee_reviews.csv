Support a small cafe instead. Imagine coming to a cafe with an online menu that says Avo on Toast is 14.50. You come in and it’s now 18.50 with weekend surcharge of 10%. You’re paying 20 dollars for Avocado on Toast which is stupid. The coffee was priced well, OR SO WE THOUGHT Portions come in. Most cafes have 2 slices of sourdough or a large sourdough toast. This is the TINIEST toast I have seen. Employees excuse is that you’re paying for the ingredients on top of it. The normal plain toast which we got is also TINY. Lastly, look at the coffee compared to an IPhone XS. This is so tiny. I would get a full cup elsewhere for 4.50. Employees excuse is the cup size is on the counter, which in my opinion is not readily seen. Paid $60 as students who didn’t realise they had increased the price this much compared to their online menu and had weekend surcharge. Also they are so busy. Genuinely don’t know why people are supporting them with these small portions and high prices",['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-mjhY3Hcnr-VGiKR3fSz2KogFCNZUXfwVeW6u=w100-h100-p-n-k-no'],,Paramount Coffee Project

But the bird's nest is not the hero of Cuckoo's signature dish. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the crispy noodle nest, bejewelled by the poached egg. It's visually stunning and adds interesting textural elements to the meal. I love a good rich golden yolk anyday, particularly when it oozes out of the nest to coat the almost wild vegetation growing underneath. But the bed of wild greens steals the show. It's just so intensely flavourful complemented nicely by light and creamy dollops of Greek yoghurt. In comparison, I feel the noodles forgot to bring anything to the flavour party. It stands awkwardly to the side being bland, not really sure what its doing there. It could've been made of crispy potatoes, fried onions or even sweet potato to counter the spicy greens - it's such a missed opportunity. I also felt the egg to salad ratio was a bit off, I think it would've been nice to have the option to add an extra egg so the dish would be less dry. Overall, ""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest"" is a crowd pleaser. It tastes pretty good while also being vegan and gluten free. The staff here were amazing and I made the experience much easier to have a great catch up with friends. 4.5/5 I'd come back. Vegetarian options: Vegetarian options are not second thoughts added to the menu, they are signature dishes. Kid-friendliness: Could bring kids here, or even fur babies and many people do.

We had to wait at least 15 minutes to be finally seated outside which was very hot. We ordered and the food took at least 45 minutes to come to our table. My friend had ordered a side of mushrooms and when they didn't come, we reminded the waiter. In the end they never gave us the dish. Food was overpriced and very average. Very disappointed.

For pretty much 90% of visits, I have waited on average 20 to 30 minutes for lukewarm coffee and the occasional food order. The owner (I think his name is Lee) has served me a few times and on each of those occasions seems completely distracted and disinterested in even greeting his customers. By far the worst experiences at this café have come during the last few times, during which I’ve been served by a female (forget her name). I have had to wait well over 20 minutes for a coffee each time in the morning before work, and twice I’ve even seen her drop things on the ground and continue to use them. The very last time I went for a morning coffee, I was on a deadline, and after waiting again for about 15 - 20 minutes for my coffee, eventually apologised and said that I would have to come back for the coffee another time, which she agreed to, but when I went back, on the weekend with not many customers in the shop, again I had to wait over 20 minutes. After she had proceeded to serve two customers who had come in after me (and whom also had to wait quite a while) and then went off to do something else, I went and asked if she was making my coffee. She seemed to have simply forgotten me or was just going to leave me standing there waiting. I asked for a refund and left. Avoid this place and save your money! Super long wait times, poor customer service, and often cold coffee. On a positive side, the food is ok, but not enough to bring me back. If you walk down Elizabeth street, towards the city a minute or so, there are heaps of much better café’s. Disappointing !!!!!",,,Meet Mica

Today I had the Vegan Salmon Bagel, and taste-wise it was the best vegan salmon I've ever had. It tasted scarily close to the animal (or as the staff responded: disgustingly good), and they actually managed to do that with a tomato. Because it was in a bagel with other ingredients, the slightly different structure goes unnoticed. I've never experienced such a perfect recreation of the taste of unprocessed fish before, so I was very much amazed. The Join The Club was also delicious and had excellent taste. The Mango Lassi was an interesting one: it tasted really good, but there was so much turmeric in there that I couldn't taste the mango. I think less turmeric would have done more justice to the mango. Afterwards we shared a brownie, which was both delicious and dense, so we had no regret in sharing. The vibe was cool, and the staff was down to earth as well. On the wall there were some intriguing pictures of individual animals from an animal sanctuary, so you know exactly why this eatery only serves vegan food.

That is certainly a compliment as this is an area heavily saturated with very good coffee establishments. There are numerous reasons for my positive review. Firstly and most importantly the coffee served here is fabulous in aroma and flavour. Additionally, observing, and listening to the owners and their staff, it is clear all share a true passion for what they do. This passion is evident as they research, source, and roast their coffee in-house. I like the unpretentious, compact, yet warm decor and inviting style evident throughout the cafe. This extends to all the staff. They are friendly, approachable, unassuming and always willing to chat. Being a avid football (soccer) fan it’s been lovely to chat and share my passion with one of the knowledgeable baristas while sipping on a lovely flat white.

I’ve been coming to Reuben Hills since 2018 as it was my favourite cafe until my most recent experience. I was initially saddened to seerye was what I came to RH for so often. I understand the change from Rye to AP Sourdough as a business decision given the links between the two cafes, however the switch from chickpea/pickled onions/dill/herb oil to inferior ingredients was disappointing however I gave it a go and was not impressed, the herb crackers were particularly bad. I understand that my personal preference is just that, and normally I wouldn’t leave a bad review over a menu change I disagree with, but that wasn’t the worst part of my experience. I also ordered a malteaser milkshake that I saw the staff drinking in front of me, which particularly appalled me. From where I was sitting I could see the milkshake being made, specifically in a tall silver milkshake glass. I then saw the staff member who made it pour out a glass worth of milkshake into a water glass and set it aside. I was then served that milkshake. A few minutes later the staff member who made the milkshake handed the extra glass to a different worker who drank it in front of me. I was honestly quite offended that neither of them had the brains or awareness to reduce/consume my $10 milkshake ANYWHERE other than right in front of me… like come on… My girlfriend also got the mushroom burrito that was way overpriced for what it was. Another menu change that has been for the worse, a definite downgrade from the previous breakfast burrito. At least with the breakfast burrito they used to cut it half and serve it in something slightly nicer than tinfoil. The menu changes were disappointing (they are also not reflected on the website which still has the old menu) but I’ve been a loyal customer for around four years and was prepared to still come back, but the whole thing with the milkshake left a sour taste in my mouth. Whatever changes have happened in the last few months since I was last there, staff and menu, have been for the worse in my opinion.",,,Reuben Hills

It's in someone's double garage almost literally. You have to traverse some sights and smells to get here. 2. Most staff who work here are categorically supercilious. 3. Coffee is ""ok"" on best of days. It does have a non-organic, slight chemical after taste to it. It is a 4/10 compared to coffee in Italy, 5/10 overall. Of late these people are ""bending their customers over"" by forcing you to bring your own cup. Rather than giving you a discount for bringing your own cup, they add 50 cents by default if you don't. 4.Food is very average. Nothing healthy, mostly dense calorie stuff that tastes good with real regret later. 5. Pricing is off the charts. Coffee (Strong large FW) and basic Toast set me back $13.60. Anywhere else $8 maybe $9 with better coffee of course. Worst of all- the general arrogance thinly veiled by forced dignity is palpable. I'd be ok with all of this had this been a Michelin star restaurant. Honestly, this is just a dingy joint with BS exposed bricks to give it the hipster feel. In conclusion, the very fact that this establishment thrives is an indictment of the mellenial outlook. I am 35 (in 2019 for reference). Please visit this joint pay $25- $30 for coffee and lunch, while the pretentious workers with piercings and tattoos waddle around.. moping how the world doesn't recognise pure gold.

We waited in line for a table and told them specifically we needed to be seated with our dog. Eventually after a lengthy wait (which we are ok with as we didn't mind waiting for a dog friendly table) we got directed to the table out the back right next to their roller door. Our pup was well behaved and quickly fell asleep under the table at our feet out of everyone's way.. About 3/4 of our way through the meal a random waitress walked by and spotted him sitting there and says quiet rudely to my partner ""mate, you can't have your dog in here, people are eating you have to tie him up outside."" We were obviously surprised as one, we had waited for a dog friendly seat had we not? And two, at her ridiculously rude attitude. So my partner left the rest of his food to go tie our pup by a pipe near the door and sat with him as he would have only been a few months old at the time he would have gotten quite stressed if we left him alone. The waitress came round again and saw my partner sitting with my pup on the floor and goes ""can't you just leave him there!?"" my partner goes on to explain that he couldn't as he would cry and disturb other people. We would have been fine to go elsewhere if told up front that they weren't pet friendly instead of getting mixed messages from different people and made to feel like we did the wrong thing! What terrible customer interaction!! I will never go back based on this experience and advise anyone else hoping to take their dog with them to avoid this place",,,Reuben Hills

Obviously upset about paying for a meal that made me sick, I posted on their Facebook wall informing them of what had happened and suggested that they should check their hygiene. I posted my comment, checked that it had successfully posted on the wall (it had). I happened to go back to the page a few minutes later and the post was gone! I thought that was strange so I posted it again. Checked that it had posted correctly (it had), then again, went back to check again in a few minutes. Again it was gone!!! So in response I posted another post which was a message to Reuben Hills/ their Facebook admin telling them what I thought of them. And surprise surprise, that post didn’t make it to the wall.

They did offer to remake the dish but given that my partner had already finished her meal at that stage, it didn't seem appropriate to wait another 25+ minutes for them to remake mine. Ultimately, I opted for a refund of my dish. What was particularly striking was the manager in charge explained the staff shortages but also rudely remarked that I should 'have some patience'.

After finding a cafe with no name, we were seated, and the staff were friendly enough, just not very helpful. We wanted 2 takeaway coffees, we did not realise that the take away section was seperate to the main area, which the lady was fine with ordering takeaways. Although all we ordered was a large flat white on zymill, and a large cap on soy. Only to be informed you apparently you only do one type of milk though so normal dairy it was. First it took 3 attempts to remember the two coffees. Then 2 coffees came to our table that weren't for us. Which caused more confusion. Finally we got our takeaway order, only the cap was small not large. Whatever I can deal with that, probably a good thing considering it was dairy. Then spent what felt like 10 mins trying to pay, but no body seemed to be interested in helping. Finally we were leaving with what was hoped to be bloody good coffees. And as we walked past the take away section, what do I see. Bloody Soy milk! This would have been ok if we didn't end up throwing out both coffees, two sips in and all mine tasted like was warm milk.

My colleague then asked if she could get her breakfast in a takeaway container so that once she has finished her coffee we could leave, they then said they refused to take the order at the table and if she wanted it to takeaway she'll have to go up and pay (unnecessarily complicated if you ask me) They also got her order wrong so once she got back to the office it was too much of a mission to go back and sort. Apparently her coffee was pretty good however so maybe worth it for that? In a place where there are so many good coffee places, they need to step up their service levels to stand out.

The person we asked for menus didn't want to take our order for coffee, so we further waited for someone else to come back. We eventually ordered coffee and food. It all arrived at different times; coffees one by one. After eating we eventually managed to order another round of coffee but they messed up the order, giving us a chai latte instead. 1.5 hours later we settled the bill and one waiter apologized, saying how busy it was, and gave us the last round of coffees on the house.

I finally did line up and after about 10 minutes of waiting, was directed to the upper level where there were about 4 free tables. Not sure what’s going on there but it’s pretty annoying to have been made to wait for no reason. My friend joined me a while later, reporting a line outside. Meanwhile, there was still some space upstairs. Never mind. Then came the fact that everything (menu, ordering, paying) had to be done online. This really, really annoyed me. Both of us were forced to bring out our phones and spend a considerable amount of time essentially online shopping. The online menu was badly set out, with options under different categories meaning you had to keep going back and forth. It kept getting worse. From being charged all sorts of extra surcharges (including to use the whole online system which I absolutely did not want to!) to being asked for my name, phone number and credit card details! We were completely turned off! We hadn’t seen each other in ages and now we were on our phones for about 15mins. It definitely prevented us from ordering anything more after that meal order. People don’t go to a cafe just to eat pretty food with quirky names. They seem to understand that but also not understand it. As for the actual meal - I had the chilli eggs which were really delicious. The coffee was quite bad.

My partner and I wanted to order some breakfast and I really liked the look of the breakfast wrap on the “takeaway only” menu but was told that I couldn’t order it to eat in. To be honest I’m not one to leave negative reviews and I understand it’s not the staffs fault that it is set up this way but it’s almost comical that food coming from the SAME kitchen cannot be eaten whilst sitting down? I truly would understand if it was takeaway only in the sense that the dine in food was too difficult to make to take away but the other way around just makes absolutely no sense and management should make some sort of change with that or Atleast give the staff a justification to tell customers when asked about the rule. I’m disappointed.,,,Cuckoo Callay on Crown

My friend and I visited Meet Mica on 4/7. We have never been to this cafe before and were really looking forward to it. We were seated and given two menus. I didn't ave any time to browse around the cafe - we just came in and sat down straight away. I wanted to get mocha and croissant. In the menu it is stated: Croissants and cakes - please check with our staff for daily choices. So I ordered a small mocha first, and asked the guy which croissants they had for the day. And he said almond, chocolate and something else. I love chocolate croissants! And that's what I ordered. My mocha came first. I would say I didn't enjoy it much - yes, the unicorn was pretty, but I would prefer good taste over looks. I couldn't really tell that it was mocha because there was no chocolate in the taste. I buy mocha specifically because I prefer chocolate coffee. Otherwise I would have bough cappuccino. If you offer this coffee to anyone - without telling them it's mocha - they would never be able to guess it's actually mocha. And then my pastry came. Well. I ordered a chocolate croissant. What I got was not a croissant. It was a different pastry. Look, I come from the Europe part of the world. Western food and western pastries are important for me. 'A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape'. Crescent shape. That's a part of croissant. I was given a different type of pastry. You might say: Oh what's the issue, it's still a chocolate pastry! Well! If I go to a restaurant and ask them for hoki, but they bring me catfish saying - oh, it's still white fish, you can eat it! Does it sound right? No. Another issue - I cut this pastry in two halves and peeped inside. Nearly NO chocolate at all! AT ALL! Make sure your partners provide you with good pastry! When we were paying the bill, I noticed croissants and other pastries near the counter. I hope it's display only? Because you are not allowed to keep food in that area? Anyway, I was very upset with my visit to Meet Mica: absolutely couldn't understand why I paid more specifically for mocha when I wasn't even able to tell that it was actually mocha, and getting another type of pastry when I clearly ordered croissant... Well. I'm done with this place. :) I sent them an email after the visit - no reaction. No simple apology. Copied the text into Google reviews. Got a reply 25 minutes later. :) Saying that I am a constantly grumpy person so they are sorry for me. :) Well FYI all positive reviews are published in my blog - negative reviews are published there as well, however it's not in English so you won't be able to read it / understand it. Google reviews in my case are mostly for complaining out loud in English - and I am absolutely allowed to do that. A simple apology via email would have saved the situation - I don't need more. But your Google reviews reply ruined everything completely. :) Thanks",,True,Meet Mica

Our first visit to this cafe was mostly positive. We ordered the omurice, karaage sanga, ice matcha latte and matcha milkshake. We had a good experience and enjoyed the food overall, particularly we appreciated the flexibility to have kimchi on the side as my husband can’t have it. My omurice was decent but I didn’t finish it because the onion was too overpowering. The egg was soft and fluffy, I loved that. The sauce was paired well and helped to balance the flavours on the dish overall. The drinks were excellent, strong and punchy matcha flavours if you enjoy that. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to go for a second visit the following weekend and brought a friend along too. However, this time for whatever reason the waitress denied the exact same order, checked with the kitchen and came back with just as strong an opinion that that simply cannot fulfil our order of having kimchi on the side. We explained that he couldn’t eat it with the kimchi inside but they just said no if you want to eat it, you must have the kimchi. So we opted not to order anything savoury and just go for lunch elsewhere. I tried the matcha mille feuille but I must say.. it looks way better than it tastes. The mille feuille was dry and didn’t have much taste, the matcha creme was grainy and did not add moisture to balance the dish. Needless to say, we will not be coming back, service is appalling and food is just average. Go for it if you like instagramable food but lower your expectations for everything else.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu5oswoBDarhsAb16symx4bzkT8A_Om9J2JttW=w100-h100-p-n-k-no', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9DpsyI5AzzzFPjP6baFv6L3ZRrM583yqhWI7t=w100-h100-p-n-k-no', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPArirbbmpamHjuHyiP0lbG_aoGEv0FQ9s8JRaZ=w100-h100-p-n-k-no']",True,Kentaro

My partner insisted on trying the signature pork sandwich, and wow looks can be deceiving. The pork katsu was very thick and just generally difficult to chew, the sandwich bread was cold. However the most disappointing was the Beef Motsu Nabe - the flavour was interesting to try, but not something you would re-order.

Their menu offers many exciting options for vegetarians/vegans, however the execution was lazy, at least for the bagel sandwiches we ordered. The bagels themselves were perfect, but I think that’s because they use Brooklyn Boy Bagels (the best around Sydney). The filling was not as impressive. We got both options (the lox and bacon egg) and weren’t happy with either. The lox just tasted like a tomato bagel. I’m shocked by how little they did to achieve any sort of similar consistency. It didn’t taste bad, but they should just market it as a bagel with tomato. The bacon egg was better, but the egg tasted like scrambled tofu. I think my biggest issue was the marketing of the items to mimic meat dishes, yet tasting nothing like it. Obviously, we eat here to avoid eating meat, but that doesn’t mean you can sell a bagel as “vegan lox” and have it be indistinguishable from tomato. Just advertise a tofu bagel and tomato bagel if that’s what you’re giving us. I’m so sad to be let this down. Maybe I’ve overhyped it in my head for too long. I think I’ll come back and try one of the sandwiches just to make sure I’m not missing anything.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFEUXTCelBKIkAnGOpYnOHT-bvZthLorxzZLrg=w100-h100-p-n-k-no', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPv3QtopJpeC5XLO2dcpAh4xMc7MsJlw9iPu5HW=w100-h100-p-n-k-no']",True,Shift Eatery

The food was good but was by no means the best vegan food that I have had. The menu is quite Limited , mostly to simple brunch items and a variety of sandwiches. We tried the pulled pork sandwich and the chicken schnitzel sandwich. The pulled pork uses jackfruit which we both felt was a poor substitute and quite an overpowering flavour. I would recommend the chicken sandwich though, which had similar texture to chicken. Despite the good substitute chicken, once again we were underwhelmed by the flavours. As compared to other brunch places in Sydney the food simply did not impress us. That said, it's great to have more vegan restaurants in Sydney and we paid $50 for 2 meals and 2 drinks.

As they still have a single origin and cold drip on offer, their focus on providing a broad coffee experience to their customers is clear. I started off with their Ethiopian Kochere Yiracheffe as an espresso and was a bit underwhelmed by what it delivered. Rather than a citrusy, floral experience, I got much more of a molasses, syrupy, dark coffee. Wasn't bad, but certainly didn't taste like I'd expect from a Yiracheffe. To finish off I grabbed a mac, and think that I suffered the latte art of macs, where to make it pretty a little too much milk is added. All I can say is give me ugly looking delicious coffee any day... :-) So while the individual coffees I had today were not excellent, the staff service and attention to each coffee does promise lots of potential.

My partner and I been looking forward to brunch but unfortunately for us we made the decision to dine at Kawa. On arrival we were quickly given a menu, ordered and sat back to enjoy each other's company .Our coffee came shortly afterwards and was OK. However, this was the last hint of speed and decent service we experienced. 35 minutes later and after watching another customer leave because his food had taken so long to come, I went to ask for an update on when to expect ours (this after watching people who had arrived after us receive their meals). The reply from our surly waiter was a simple ""it's coming soon"", delivered with a look of poorly masked disdain and haughtiness. After a further ten minutes, my partner and I had decided that by 1:55pm (a full 50+) minutes after arriving, we would simply have to leave as I am a type one diabetic and had taken insulin for the meal but much to our relief (albeit short lived), our food finally arrived, delivered with a furtive apology for it's lateness (which I would classify as the understatement of the year). I should have known better though. If only the food had made up for the appalling wait and waiter. My partner had ordered the open sandwich with cheese and tomato. What came out from the kitchen was a beige horror with barely melted cheese on top of tomato. I can only assume they'd used a 50 watt lightbulb which is why it took 55 minutes to prepare and had no hint of grilling in sight. I ordered a big breakfast with haloumi. The haloumi was the best bit (presumably because they didn't make it) and the rest wasn't the worst I've had in a café but the mushrooms were wet and flavourless, the bacon fatty, the eggs over cooked and the tomato a soggy mess that reminded me of over cooked cauliflower you had a kid which disintegrates into mush when the air brushes over it. We left shortly after and received no further apology for the wait (which was never flagged to us). Nor was there any kind of gesture made as an apology. This wasn't surprising but perhaps two free coffees would have been possible? Again, I should have known better... The person who I assume was the owner was infinitely more apologetic than his waiter but despite this, being in my 30s, I'll simply never have the time to attend Kawa for a meal again.",,,Kawa

The sandwich was not toasted, cold bread that seemed to be from the supermarket, the bacon was soggy and only just cooked, and they also decided to include cold spinach in the sandwich - not sure why.

Great if you were a vegan or vegetarian, their simple offerings seemed to be all vegetarian, at least today they were. We turned up at 11:30am based on the great reviews on Google and here. Their vegan pies and two salads (no meat) on offer today were not ready. We were told a 10 minutes wait for the pumpkin soup and toast. We didn't mind waiting while having our coffee. We were actually after something a little more substantial but that will do for now as we were feeling cold and hungry. They do have a small table at the back in the corner. Two persons can sit up at the corner wall sides. The rest are a few low wooden cubes along the narrow wall. And two stools at the front window. The people were friendly, the coffee were great, probably one of the best tasting in Sydney. The homemade pumpkin soup was also tasty, I like the fact that no cream were added. I guess they used spices like cumin and turmeric, there were also roasted pumpkin seeds. It was a great health choice.

Situated at the top of Bourke Street just below Oxford, it’s a natural convergence between Surry Hills, Paddington, and Darlinghurst. There are always a lot of outdoor seats in the mini-square and along the sidewalk. Even on Mother’s Day we were able to get a table for two immediately without a reservation. In a way it might even be too much seating—didn’t totally feel like I had a comfortable amount of space so I docked one star for that. It is certainly dog-friendly in that you can have your pup with you, but didn’t see much water bowls being offered out to the pups. And on more than one occasion we overheard or saw a dog at another table getting a little excited at the proximity of other dogs be it at neighboring tables or just passing close by on the street. I went with the fried chicken burger with kimchi and chips and it was very satisfying. The fried chicken skin was satisfyingly crunchy, and the kimchi, while messy, was undoubtedly delicious, and I don’t even like kimchi that much (gasp!). Partner had a tuna Niçoise salad and I was surprised that it was served on a bed of beans, olives, potatoes, and something green like an olive with a stem. I’m not a fan of olives, but my partner found it to be quite good, and filling—we ended up taking some of it away with us. And honorable mention for being adjacent to Lavie & Belle. The bakery right next door added the irresistible fragrance of freshly baked bread to our dining experience, and if I wasn’t so full after my burger I would have definitely picked up some croissants for dessert.","['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4md_Mpec6JFZenc3PgO02NGhm8Exf9IQR0ueE=w100-h100-p-n-k-no', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGV36cifm6nEdO84F7VUDaZU6vxbYGymSmSrZW=w100-h100-p-n-k-no', 'https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe5OlqJXAQ5PWUPk71nUNQ1VWObvTOzmu_puwV=w100-h100-p-n-k-no']",True,Lumiere Cafe

So much of it looks home-made, like the delicious Burek cheese or potato-filled pastry. The portions are generous and not at all expensive. We sat down inside but there are also options to sit outside near the footpath. Food can be served in a very short time in your lunch hour, and you can choose some things from behind hot and cold counters. You'll want to come back and try other specialities.",,,Balkan Butler

This is a beautiful dessert that isn't commonly found in Australia, and the matriarch of this family owned operation makes it with pride. I recommend the coffee on any day, but definitely check out the lunches and the handmade desserts too.",,True,Balkan Butler
